_[Detailed changes since v1.7.2](https://github.com/higlass/higlass/compare/v1.7.2...v1.8.0)_

## v1.7.2

- Refactored the scroll options and `bounded` into a new property called `sizeMode`. There are now 4 different size modes, which determine the visible height of the HiGlass instance:
  1. `default`: the height is given by the sum of the tracks' heights
  2. `bounded`: tells the HiGlass component to bind the height to the parent container by dynamically adjusting the height of center tracks.
  3. `scroll`: will activate scrolling by stretching HiGlass' drawing surface to the extent of parent DOM element and hiding overflowing content in the x direction and allowing to scroll when content overflows in the y direction.
  4. `overflow`: same as `scroll` except that you can't scroll. This mode is only needed when you want to dynamically switch between scrolling and pan+zooming.
