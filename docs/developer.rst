following are a set of guidelines to help ensure that contributions can be smoothly 
merged into the existing code base:

1. All code contributions should be accompanied by a test. Tests can be placed into the `test`
   folder.
2. All added functions should include a jsdoc string for javascript code or a numpy style 
   docstring for python code.
